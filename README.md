# ProgSoc Beginners' JavaScript 2024

> 6pm, 10th October 2024

This is the repository for the *Beginners' JavaScript* Workshop.

If you're coming from the *Live Page*, see the source code <https://github.com/ProgSoc/JavaScript2024>.

By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to use your skills to:

* Set up local `.html` pages with `.css` styles and `.js` scripts,
* Access and consume APIs using [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch),
* Use JavaScript to manipulate the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model).

You'll also have built a working [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) clone, that you can keep tinkering with to make it your own!
